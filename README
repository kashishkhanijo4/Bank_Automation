Bank Management System:
First of all, whole code is written by me and nothing has been copy pasted fron anywhere.

The project has Dependencies which are all open sourced (modules such as sqlite, mysql-connector)

Requirements:
Python 3
MySQL workbench 8.0
Sqlite
because I've tested the code using these versions only...

Setup:
Run the file named "main.py" and follow the instructions of the program...

How to reset:
Open the file named "firsttime.txt" and change the value from False to True (case sensitive)

Troubleshooting:
I suspect that the people who haven't set a password for SQL may encounter an error. (will fix it later)

I strongly suggest users to have a password set in MySQL.

Check if the terminal shows the message "Connection established successfully"

That means you entered your credentials properly

Any other exception will pop up in the terminal...
